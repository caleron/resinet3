about.frame.text=ResiNeT is a tool for exact computation of network reliability and resilience.\n\
It was developed as part of projects and theses at\nthe University of Hamburg \
in the department of computer science.
help.frame.text=Distinguish between two types of vertices: Terminal vertices and non-terminal vertices:\n\n\
  Actions for drawing a network:\n\
  draw non-terminal vertext: left click\n\
  draw terminal vertex: right click\n\
  changing terminal state: right click or <ctrl>+left click on the vertext\n\
  delete vertex: middle click (mouse wheel) or <shift>+left click\n\
  draw edge: drag mouse with pressed left mouse button from one vertex to another vertex\n\n\
  You can also select a set of nodes. Selected nodes can be copied, pasted, moved or resized.\n\n\
  Generate a network topology by using the menu item "generate graph" in the graph menu.\n\n\
  You may save a graph as a file when completed. ResiNeT is capable of using two file types:\n\
  The Pajek file format and an own file format, which can be used to save the reliabilities\n\
  of vertices and edges along with the network graph.
