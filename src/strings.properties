graph_panel_title=Please first input your network graph\:
graph_help_text=On this panel you can draw the graph of your network after a click on the \"Draw\" button.\nDistinguish between two types of vertices\:\nPress the left button of your input device (i.e. mouse) to draw a white non-terminal vertex and the right button to draw a black terminal vertex.\nTo turn an already drawn vertex into a terminal vertex point to it, hold the Ctrl-Key and press the right button of your input device.\nDelete a vertex or an edge by holding the <shift>-key and left clicking it.\nTo draw an edge press the left button when the mouse pointer is on a vertex and hold it. Then drag the mouse to another vertex and release it. \n\nWhen you have completed the graph of the network, you may save it as a file by pressing the Save Network button above.\n\nYou can also import a previously created network (ResiNeT or Pajek) by clicking the \"Load\" button.
